## Brief Background Description:
Telecom is a nationwide company that provides telephone, TV, Internet

## Project Goal:
* **Target marketing based on customer segmentation:** Use K-Means to divide our customers into 4 different groups, and
then marketing department employees can utilize this information to target the customers.
* **Predict customer behavior for potential purchases:** Use regression models based on customer personal information to predict
how much money such customers would like to spend in the future.
* **Create a product recommendation system:** Use classification models based on customer personal information to predict 
which contract s/he may be interested in signing and target our customers with different marketing strategies.
